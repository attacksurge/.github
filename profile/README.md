# AttackSurge

**Unleashing Distributed Scanning for Everyone**

At AttackSurge, our mission is to make distributed scanning accessible and transparent for everyone. We believe that every security professional, researcher, and bug bounty enthusiast should have the tools and resources to rapidly assess and protect their digital infrastructure—without the overhead of costly, monolithic scanning setups.

## Our Story

Born out of the desire to democratize security scanning, AttackSurge was created to break down the barriers that traditionally limit large-scale scanning operations. By leveraging cloud providers and open-source methodologies, we empower users to control their scanning infrastructure on their own terms. We’re a passionate community continuously learning, iterating, and sharing knowledge.
