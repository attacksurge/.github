# AttackSurge

**⚡ Distributed Cloud Scanning on Your Terms**

## Introduction
AttackSurge builds open-source tools to make large-scale security scanning fast, flexible, and transparent for everyone. We empower security professionals, researchers, and bug bounty hunters to run distributed scans in their own cloud environments — on their own terms, with no heavy, monolithic setups required.

## Projects
