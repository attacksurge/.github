# AttackSurge

**Unleashing Distributed Scanning for Everyone**

At AttackSurge, our mission is to make distributed scanning accessible and transparent for everyone. We believe that every security professional, researcher, and bug bounty enthusiast should have the tools and resources to rapidly assess and protect their digital infrastructure—without the overhead of costly, monolithic scanning setups.

## Our Story

Born out of the necessity to quickly scan millions of hosts and the desire to democratize security scanning, AttackSurge was created to dismantle the traditional hurdles of large-scale scanning by harnessing the power of cloud providers and open-source tools. Our mission is simple: give you full control over your scanning infrastructure, on your own terms. As a vibrant community, we’re constantly evolving—learning, refining, and sharing insights to stay ahead of emerging threats.
